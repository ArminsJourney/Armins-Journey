## What is this?<a name="what-is-this"></a>

This is where I store the projects I am working on. Take a look and see!

## About Me<a name="about-me"></a>
I am a former chemistry student with a great interest in data analysis. I (properly) started my coding journey around August 2022 by learning python and working through some ebooks on **data science** and **machine learning**. I intend to update this repository with some of my smaller and larger projects (They still need some polishing :sweat_smile: ), and whatever else I am working on. Expect to see more here, soon<sup>*TM*</sup>!

## Structure of this Repo <a name="structure-of-this-repo"></a>
"Courses" contains my notebooks and some of the accompanying material that accumulates while I work through different online courses.

"Projects" will contain all of the projects I am working on currently or that I have finished already. From tiny to hopefully fairly large ones.
