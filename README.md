## What is this?:thinking:<a name="what-is-this"></a>

This is where I store everything code-related that I am working on. Take a look and see!

## About Me :test_tube::lab_coat::point_right::bar_chart::computer:<a name="about-me"></a>
I am a former chemistry student with a great interest in data analysis. I (properly) started my coding journey around August 2022 by learning python and working through some ebooks on **data science** and **machine learning**. I intend to update this repository with some of my smaller and larger projects (They still need some polishing :sweat_smile: ), and whatever else I am working on. Expect to see more here, soon<sup>*TM*</sup>!

## Structure of this Repo:card_index_dividers:<a name="structure-of-this-repo"></a>
**"Courses"** contains my notebooks and some of the accompanying material that accumulates while I work through different online courses. I will treat **Ebooks** as if they were online courses, too!

**"Projects"** will contain all of the projects I am working on currently or that I have finished already. From tiny to hopefully fairly large ones.
