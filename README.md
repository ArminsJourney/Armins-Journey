### What is this?<a name="what-is-this"></a>



### About Me<a name="about-me"></a>
I am a former chemistry student with a great interest in data analysis. I (properly) started my coding journey about half a year ago by learning python and working through some ebooks on **data science** and **machine learning**. I intend to update this repository with some of my smaller and larger projects (They still need some polishing ^^ ), and whatever else I am working on. Expect to see more here, soon!
